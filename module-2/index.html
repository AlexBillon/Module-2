  							<p class="p">ITALY</p>
							<section>Italian cuisine (Italian: cucina italiana) has developed through centuries of social and political changes, with roots stretching to antiquity.
							Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century. Italian cuisine is noted for its regional diversity, abundance of difference in taste, and it is probably the most popular in the world, with influences abroad.
